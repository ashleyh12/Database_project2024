-- Insert into Department: This adds a new department with DeptID 1 named "Computer Science".
INSERT INTO Department (DeptID, Name) VALUES (1, 'Computer Science');
-- Insert into Course: Adds a course named "Intro to Computer Science" (CS101) for the Fall semester of 2023, belonging to the Computer Science department (DeptID 1).
INSERT INTO Course (CourseID, DeptID, Number, Name, Semester, Year) VALUES (1, 1, 'CS101', 'Intro to Computer Science', 'Fall', 2023);
-- Insert into Student: Adds two students, John Doe and Jane Q Doe, with StudentIDs 1 and 2, respectively.
INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe'), (2, 'Jane', 'Q Doe');
-- Insert into Enrollment: Registers John and Jane in the course CS101 by creating enrollment records linking the students to the course.
INSERT INTO Enrollment (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID) VALUES (1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1);
-- Insert into AssignmentCategory: Creates two categories of assignments for the courseâ€”Homework and Exam, homework weighed at 20% and the exam at 50%
INSERT INTO AssignmentCategory (CategoryID, CourseID, Name, Weight) VALUES (1, 1, 'Homework', 20.00), (2, 1, 'Exam', 50.00),(3, 1, 'Course Participation', 10.00),(4, 1, 'Projects', 20.00);
-- Insert into Assignment: Adds two assignments, "HW1" under the Homework category and "Midterm" under the Exam category.
INSERT INTO Assignment (AssignmentID, CategoryID, Name) VALUES (1, 1, 'HW1'), (2, 2, 'Midterm');
-- Insert into Scores: Records scores for both students on both assignments, such as John scoring 85 on HW1 and 78 on Midterm.
INSERT INTO Scores (ScoreID, AssignmentID, StudentID, Score) VALUES (1, 1, 1, 85.00), (2, 1, 2, 90.00), (3, 2, 1, 78.00), (4, 2, 2, 88.00);

-- Select from Student: Retrieves all records from the Student table.
SELECT * FROM Student;

-- Join Student and Enrollment: Fetches the details of students enrolled in the course with CourseID 1 (CS101). This query specifically filters to show students in this course
SELECT s.StudentID, s.FirstName, s.LastName
FROM Student s
JOIN Enrollment e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
WHERE e.CourseID = 1;

-- Complex Join Including Scores: This more complex query retrieves a list of students in CourseID 1, along with their scores on all assignments. It joins several tables to collect this information:

-- Student to get student names.
-- Enrollment to filter students by course.
-- Scores to get the scores for each student.
-- Assignment to get the names of the assignments.
-- AssignmentCategory and Course are joined through the chain but not directly used in the selection; however, they are necessary to link assignments to courses.
